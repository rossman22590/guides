Markdoc is great for writing structured content, where your page would typically consist of Markdown content, and some predefined components. *Predefined*, because Markdoc requires you to list all the components and their attributes in a schema, before using them with their custom `{% %}` syntax. This is great when your components are essentially static, or at most parametrized in a simple way, using for instance strings and numbers:
</TwoOfThreeCols>

```
{% note type="info" %}An informational note{% /note %}
```

<TwoOfThreeCols>
But what if we wanted our component to include some content that cannot be represented with simple types? Say, we want a note component to include a custom icon, represented as a React component? In MDX, there is a natural way to do this, because MDX understands React/JSX and module imports in the page itself. Markdoc also understands React/JSX, but it requires an extra step, which we will describe here.

In MDX, our note component with a custom icon could be created on the fly as follows:
</TwoOfThreeCols>

```jsx
import { Note } from "@components/ui/note"
import { Warning } from "@components/icons"

<Note type="info" icon={WarningIcon}>
  An informational note
</Note>
```

<TwoOfThreeCols>
In Markdoc, there is currently no way to set a custom Markdoc component, let alone a JSX component, as an attribute to another component. Instead, we need to use a set of predefined primitive values that we want to support for our icons (e.g. `questionMark`, `exclamationMark`, `xMark`), and map these to the appropriate icons within our JSX definition.

Our Note component could be written like this:
</TwoOfThreeCols>

```jsx
// /components/ui/note.jsx
import { useMemo } from "react"
import { QuestionMark, ExclamationMark, XMark } from "@components/icons"

const getIconForId = (iconId) => {
  switch (iconId) {
    case "exclamationMark": return <ExclamationMark className="w-4 h-4 text-amber-500" />
    case "xMark": return <XMark className="w-4 h-4 text-rose-500" />
    default: return <QuestionMark className="w-4 h-4 text-sky-500" />
  }
}

export const Note = ({ type, iconId, children }) => {
  const Icon = useMemo(() => {
    return getIconForId(iconId)
  }, [iconId])

  return <div className="flex flex-row gap-2">
      {Icon}
      {children}
    </div>
}
```

<TwoOfThreeCols>

In order to use it, we need to define our Note component in our Markdoc schema, which is located in `/markdoc.config.js`:

</TwoOfThreeCols>


```js
const config = {
  tags: {
    note: {
      render: 'Note',
      children: ['paragraph', 'tag', 'list'],
      attributes: {
        type: {
          type: String,
          default: 'info',
          matches: ['info', 'warning', 'danger'],
        },
        iconId: {
          type: String,
          default: 'questionMark',
          matches: ['questionMark', 'exclamationMark', 'xMark'],
        },
      },
    }
  }
}
```

<TwoOfThreeCols>

If you haven't already, we also need to tell what the `Note` component refers to, in `/markdoc.components.js`:

```js
import { Note } from '@components/ui/note'

export default {
  Note,
  // Other components accessible to Markdoc
}
```

Now, we can use our Note component with an icon reference in our Markdoc pages, as follows:

</TwoOfThreeCols>

```
{% note type="info" iconId="questionMark" %}My informational note{% /note %}
```
